# Django Unchained

Dipping toes into the land of Django 

## Description

This repo reflects my attempt to learn the Django framework from scratch. I'm adequately adept in Python and previously have done extensive micro-service oriented development via Flask, Starlette, FastAPI, etc. However, I don't have any prior experience of working with Django.

Initially, I'm not going through the official documentation or reading any tutorial in general. Instead, I'm working my way through these three books by [Willium S. Vincent](https://www.amazon.com/William-S-Vincent/e/B07B38Y8SG/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1):

* [Django for Beginners](https://www.amazon.com/Django-Beginners-Build-websites-Python/dp/1983172669)
* [Django for Professionals](https://www.amazon.com/Django-Professionals-Production-websites-Python/dp/1081582162)
* [Django for APIs](https://www.amazon.com/Django-APIs-Build-web-Python/dp/1093633948)
